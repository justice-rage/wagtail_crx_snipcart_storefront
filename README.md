# Wagtail CRX Snipcart Storefront

This project integrates [Wagtail CRX](https://docs.coderedcorp.com/wagtail-crx/) and [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/). Allowing individuals to get a robust e-commerce store off the ground quickly. Navigate to the official wagtail CRX Snipcart Template (here)[https://github.com/justicepelteir/wagtail-crx-snipcart-template] to get started quickly.

## Integrated Version Status

|                        |                      |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Wagtail CRX         | 1.0 |
| Snipcart                  | 3.0 |

## Why did I decide to integrate Wagtail CRX and Snipcart?
I decided to utilize the following three technologies because of the following reasons in no specific order:
- Well maintained
- Well documented
- Expedites development time
- Equips end users with advanced tools from inception

### Main Tech Stack Summaries
#### Wagtail CMS
> Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django, with a strong community and commercial support. It's focused on user experience, and offers precise control for designers and developers.

#### Wagtail CRX
> CRX, formerly known as CodeRed CMS, provides a large set of enhancements and pre-built components for Wagtail which are ready to use out-of-the box! This saves development time and avoids "re-inventing the wheel" by providing features commonly needed by websites.

#### Snipcart
> It's simple, fully customizable, well documented, regularly maintained, updated, and includes a robust e-commerce dashboard.

## Quick start

##### Create a Wagtail CRX Project
1. Run `pip install coderedcms`

2. Run `coderedcms start mysite --sitename "My Company Inc." --domain www.example.com`

    *Note: `--sitename` and `--domain` are optional to pre-populate settings of your website.*

3. Enter the project `cd mysite/`

##### The Secret Spice

4. Copy and paste the models from this repository at `wagtail_crx_snipcart_storefront/website/models.py` into your projects `models.py` file.

5. Copy and paste the `base.html` file in `wagtail_crx_snipcart_storefront/website/templates/coderedcms/pages` of this repository into your projects `base.py` file.

6. Create a `products_page.html` file in `project_name/website/templates/coderedcms/pages`

7. Copy and paste `products_page.html` from this repository located at `wagtail_crx_snipcart_storefront/website/templates/coderedcms/pages` into your `projects product_page.html` file.

8. Create a `products_index_page.html` file in `project_name/website/templates/coderedcms/pages`

9. Copy and paste `products_index_page.html` from this repository located at `wagtail_crx_snipcart_storefront/website/templates/coderedcms/pages` into your projects `product_index_page.html` file.  

10. Create a `snippets` folder in `project_name/website/templates/coderedcms`

11. Create a `navbar.html` file in `project_name/website/templates/coderedcms/snippets`

12. Copy and paste `navbar.html` from this repository located at `wagtail_crx_snipcart_storefront/website/templates/coderedcms/snippets` into your projects `navbar.html` file.

##### Implement Secret Spice

13. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the core models.
   - Wagtail CRX, by default, utilizes SQLite. Set up your preferred database solution to save yourself the headache of a database migration.
      - If you choose PostgreSQL, feel free to leverage [my tutorial](https://www.justicedouglas.com/blog/creating-wagtail-crx-project-with-postgresql/).

14. Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create the initial admin user.

15. Run `python manage.py runserver` to launch the development server, and go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, or `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to log in with your admin account.

16. Create a [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) account and get your **Public Test API Key**.

17. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/settings/website/snipcartsettings` and paste your **Public Test API Key** into the *Snipcart API Key* input field.
   - Once your e-commerce store is ready to go live and sell to customers, you will replace the **Public API Test Key** with the **Public Live API Key** provided by Snipcart. 

##### The Miracle that is ngrok

18. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), and add *ngrok provided* authtoken.
   - [Official Snipcart ngrok Documentation](https://snipcart.com/blog/develop-a-snipcart-powered-website-locally-using-ngrok)
   - Snipcart cannot communicate with your local machine. Thus local development is impossible without making your local development server available to Snipcart. Ngrok solves this pain point.
   - If utilizing Mac OS, I suggest installing ngrok via the Homebrew option.

19. In a separate terminal run `ngrok http <localhost number>`.
   - Example: `ngrok http 8080`

20. If successful you will see a ngrok session status appear. Copy the *forwarding url*.
   - Example: `https://<string-of-random-numbers-and-letters>.ngrok.io`

21. Navigate to your Snipcart dashboard, open account options (click on the upper right-hand corner human icon), and click on *Domains & URLS*.

22. In the Domain field, paste the ngrok forwarding url. 

23. In the protocol field, select `https`

24. Press the save button on the *Domains & URLS* page. 
    - IMPORTANT NOTE: Everytime you need to create a new ngrok tunnel you must update this. Otherwise, you will experience a checkout error.

25. Paste your ngrok forwarding url into your search bar and hit enter. It should take you to your project in a tab with a ngrok tunnel capable of making transactions with Snipcart.
   - If the url activates a *Deceptive site ahead* page from Google Chrome, click on *details* and press *visit this unsafe site.*

26. In a separate tab, paste your local host url that is running the project - Example: `http://localhost:8000`
   - IMPORTANT NOTE: You must have two separate tabs open and use them in unison.
      - `https://<string-of-random-numbers-and-letters>.ngrok.io` --> Can make Snipcart transactions. Can't access the admin dashboard.
      - `http://localhost:8000` --> Can't make Snipcart transactions. Can access the admin dashboard.

##### The Final Stretch

27. In the **admin capable tab**, create a test product via signing into the admin and creating a *Products Landing Page*. After creation, navigate to your newly created *Products Landing Page* in the admin and click create *child page*. Fill out all required product information, and press *publish* when done.

28. In the **transaction capable tab**, add the product to your cart and attempt to check out.
    - You should now be able to perform transactions (only test transactions are covered in this guide), which are required to [populate your product data into your Snipcart accounts dashboard](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/dashboard/store-management#5-products).

29. Congratulations, you have successfully made a test transaction! ðŸŽ‰ 
   - You will be able to see your transaction in your Snipcart dashboard.

#### Quick Start Disclaimer
1. It is your responsibility to manage your Snipcart-provided APIs properly.
2. It is your responsibility to read all pertinent documentation not covered here.
3. Upon completing the quickstart you should have a fully functional non-live project capable of making test transactions.
4. It is your responsibility to ensure you have chosen and correctly configured a database that scales proportionally to your ambitions. 
5. Before deploying your project to production, you are responsible for protecting sensitive data pertaining to your project, such as database environmental variables and other sensitive information.

## Project Screenshots
##### Disclaimer
Due to the passionately long nature of the example customer's email, the email text runs into the billing address text in screenshots seven and eight. Under normal email length circumstances provided by test users, not hellbent on [pressuring Tacobell to bring back the XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito](https://www.change.org/p/taco-bell-bring-back-the-xxl-grilled-stuffed-burrito), this text conflict would not occur.

##### Note
I decided not to share screenshots of the admin as it should be straightforward with a combination of the official documentation and this README.

## Bugs
None currently known.

## Room for Improvement
1. Add tests for newly developed features.
   - Goal: Implement TDD for future development.
2. Make feature that allows end user to elect to have the snipcart shopping cart panels reflect websites styling.

## Recommended Hosting Solution
[CodeRed Cloud](https://www.codered.cloud/)

## Future Plans
I plan to create a Python Package based on this project to give back to the community that got me into programming. The goal is to make creating a Wagtail-based e-commerce store as simple as spinning up a CRX project and pip-installing the package.
